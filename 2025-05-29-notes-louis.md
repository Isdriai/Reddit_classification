Notes from Louis-Olivier (proposal)
===================================

> how platform design and participation rules contribute to forming norms, identities, and margins
I believe there is a strong political aspect to this.
The “norm” is not something natural, but political; acquired through forces.
It’s about the “struggle in discourse” – see Stuart Hall's 1980 paper *Encoding/decoding*, e.g. with the notion of "oppositional reading" – reading is a political action, within the "politics of signification".
A short excerpt:

> Finally, it is possible for a viewer perfectly to understand both the literal and the connotative inflection given by a discourse but to decode the message in a *globally* contrary way.
> He/she detotalizes the message in the preferred code in order to retotalize the message within some alternative framework of reference.
> This is the case of the viewer who listens to a debate on the need to limit wages but “reads” every mention of the “national interest” as “class interest”.
> He/she is operating with what we must call an *oppositional code*.
> One of the most significant political moments (they also coincide with crisis points within the broadcasting organizations themselves, for obvious reasons) is the point when events which are normally signified and decoded in a negotiated way begin to begiven an oppositional reading.
> Here the “politics of signification” – the struggle in discourse – is joined.
> (Hall, p. 173)

> I see strong overlaps between your focus on the performative and material construction of digital environments and the kinds of empirical investigations I’m considering.
Editorialization can be a useful framework to start with (more of a general attitude), but I think one should take care not to indulge too much into a structuralist approach (minor detail).

Also potentially interesting to think about: the **distribution of the construction of meaning** (platform vs user vs 3rd party/authority…).
How do users create narratives? How are they disabled by a particular protocol, interface design, social norms/practices, community rules, etc.
Difficult to quantify (for me), but your technical skills might open up possibilities :)

> This bottom-up, user-driven mapping method is grounded in network theory, specifically, the assumption that individuals with similar dispositions tend to gather in overlapping digital places.
Actor-Network Theory is a nice starting point for a more sensitive observer; however, in my personal opinion, it doesn’t necessarily equate to strong, quantifiable arguments.
(also see “agential realism” from Karen Barad)
(also, not sure in which sense you are using ANT. Are other dynamics, such as algorithms, political regimes, religion, economical factors, subcultures e.g. car culture / petro-masculinism, libertarian communities, etc. potentially considered?)

> One line of inquiry would start with a single subreddit associated with extremist discourse.
"extremist" would probably have to be defined more specifically/formally… otherwise anything will have to be interpreted (very subjectively), which is cognitively expensive, and, well, unfeasible…

Possible perspective of interest: the study of "specific signifiers" (cf. Hall). Specific events (e.g. historical, current, …) will resonate through particular images, textual references, memes… (although they are not *the* event itself).

> How do platforms editorialize reality?
A specific approach could be defined, from the point of view of a scientific culture/tradition i.e. existing literature around platform studies (Wendy Hui Kyong Chun, for a hybrid engineering + cultural approach); software studies (e.g. media theorists like Lev Manovich); critical code studies (e.g. literary studies like Mark C. Marino); NLP/NLU; sentiment analysis (psychology, industrial relations); gender studies; etc.
Historical approach: how hackers (computer enthusiasts, see Steven Levy 1984) shaped technologies that we have today (overly white male, libertarian, …).
Modularity of UNIX systems (Tara McPherson 2012 on the social consequences of this seemingly good idea).

> How do digital architectures mediate subjectivity, presence, and authority?
(Note: this is what personally interests me the most – digital urbanities, digital space as a real space, where things actually happen, and where political forces are currently in a large concentration.)

Communication studies.
Remediation (Bolter & Grusin), Excommunication (Galloway, Thacker & Wark).
Communication studies (Stuart Hall again).
Everything in the digital is **highly mediated**, with actual inscriptions (code as text for analysis).
Gamer culture has this interesting thing about high-end, attention to detail technical specs (custom setups, CPU/GPU vitals and FPS monitoring, etc.) because they are very demanding of their hardware and thus very attentive/sensitive to material processes.
